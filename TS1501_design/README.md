# About

TS15 â€“ TROPIC01 Raspberry Pi Shield
A KiCad-based hardware project designed to connect the TROPIC01 device to a Raspberry Pi via the standard 40-pin GPIO header.

This shield enables straightforward integration of TROPIC01 into Raspberry Pi-based development and testing environments.
It is intended for development, evaluation, and prototyping use.

# Manufacturing instructions:

## Assembly

Because the Raspberry Pi has male GPIO pins, the shield's socket must be assembled on the bottom side 
to connect properly when placed on top of the Pi. \

There are no any special requirements for C and R components.
Where not specified the R tolerance is 5% and C 20%.

## PCB

  Number of cu layers: 2 \
  Board Thickness: 1.6 \
  Core: FR4 \
  Size: 56 x 65mm \
  Mask: Blue \
  Silkscreen: Yes (TOP only)
